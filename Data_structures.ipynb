        "    Performance Slower for iteration and less memory efficient. Faster for iteration and more memory efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Describe how dictionaries store data?\n",
        "  \n",
        "   --> Dictonaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.\n",
        "           for ex:- 'brand': 'Ford'\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   ---> We use sets instead of a list in python because sets cannot have multiple occurrences of the same element.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   ---> In Python, a string is an immutable sequence of characters enclosed in\n",
        "  single or double quotes, while a list is a mutable, ordered collection of items enclosed in square bracket.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  ---> Tuples are immutable to ensure that their contents remain constant throughout their lifecycle, guaranteeing data integrity and reliability. This immutability allows tuples to be used as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets, as they can be hashed.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   ---> A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs, using a hash function to map keys to specific locations for fast retrieval, and Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables.\n",
        "  \n",
        "9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   ---> Yes, liat contain different data types. In Python, lists can contain heterogeneous data types and objects. For instance, integers, strings, and even functions can be stored within the same list.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  --->In Python, strings are made immutable so that programmers cannot alter the contents of the object. This avoids unnecessary bugs.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   ---> Dictionaries excel over lists for tasks involving quick data retrieval and mapping relationships, due to their ability to access values by keys rather than indices, offering faster lookup time.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Fast Data Retrieval: Dictionaries use a hash table implementation, allowing for near-instantaneous access to values based on their associated keys, unlike lists which require sequential searching.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Key-Value Pair Organization: Dictionaries are designed to store data as key-value pairs, making it easy to associate and retrieve related information.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   ---> There may be some occasions when we don't want our data to be changed. If we have data that's not meant to be changed in the first place — such as critical information or records — we should choose tuple data type over lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  ---> In a set, no duplicates are allowed. Every element in a set must be unique. We can simply add elements to a set, and finally we will get a set of elements with duplicates removed automatically. HashSet, LinkedHashSet and TreeSet are the implementations of Set interface which does not allow duplicate elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   ---> The in keyword allows developers to test whether strings, tuples, lists and other sequence-based data types contain a certain value. in keyword can be used to test whether certain characters are present in a string or a certain value present in a list or tuple.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  ---> No, we cannot directly modify the elements of a tuple in Python because tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation, unlike lists which are mutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   ---> A nested dictionary is a dictionary where the values are themselves dictionaries, allowing for hierarchical data organization. A use case is representing employee records by department, with each employee's details stored in a nested dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  ---> Accessing elements in a dictionary (or hash map) typically has an average time complexity of O(1), meaning it takes constant time regardless of the dictionary's size. However, in the worst-case scenario (e.g., many collisions), it can degrade to O(n).\n",
        "\n",
        "18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   ---> lists are preferred over dictionaries for quick data look-ups, configurations, or caches, favor dictionaries. For ordered collections and sequence operations, such as maintaining a stack or queue, lists are more suitable.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "\n",
        "  ---> Dictionaries are considered unordered because they store data as key-value pairs, and the order in which these pairs are inserted doesn't affect how they are stored or retrieved; accessing data relies on keys, not position.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  ---> In terms of data retrieval, lists use numerical indices (starting from 0) for accessing elements, while dictionaries use keys to access associated values, offering significantly faster lookups than lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. Write a code to create a string with your name and print it?\n",
        "\n",
